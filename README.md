# AutoArchivingTool

A Maven project. Simple software that allows the user to copy and paste folders at command or scheduling the actions 
to run automatically at specified times.

This software allows the user to copy and paste files/folders from a path to another which are contained in the Excel file named "AutoArchivingPaths_ToBeSetManually.xlsx". Please do not change name/extension of it. Simplhy substitute the paths in column A and C, the file is already populated with an example.

You can download the project an import it as an existing Maven project or if you just want to use the program you can run the .jar simply by double clicking it, note that you will still need the other files to be in the same folder where the .jar is located as all the paths are based on the location of it.
